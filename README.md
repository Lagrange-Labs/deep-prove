# ZKML: Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning Inference

Welcome to **ZKML**, a cutting-edge framework designed to prove neural network inference using zero-knowledge cryptographic techniques. Whether you're working with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ZKML offers a fast and efficient way to verify computations without revealing the underlying data.

## What Does ZKML Do?

ZKML leverages advanced cryptographic methods like sumchecks and logup GKR to achieve sublinear proving times. This means you can prove the correctness of your model's inference faster than ever before!

### Benchmark Highlights

- **Proving Time**: _[Insert Proving Time Here]_
- **Verification Time**: _[Insert Verification Time Here]_

## Licensing

- **ZKML**: Licensed under a special Lagrange license.
- **Rest of the Code**: Licensed under Apache + MIT, as per the original repository.
